An GWT example project, that combines the concept of Activities and Places with Ajax crawling (http://code.google.com/intl/de/web/ajaxcrawling).

It is based on the HelloMVP tutorial in the GWT documentation (http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=Tutorial-hellomvp-2.1.zip).
